# SpellFade

This jquery plugin makes it possible to fade in text letter by letter.
Usage:
```
$("#myelement").spellFadeIn(800,100);
$("#myelement").spellFadeOut(800,100);
```
The first parameter defines the duration until the whole text is displayed, while the second one defines the duration until a single letter is shown.
